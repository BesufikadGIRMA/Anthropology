This discussion is particularly important for    Social Sciences in Health, as our projects must necessarily be presented to    Committees for assessment. In actual fact, Resolution Nº 196/1996 issued    by the National Health Council establishes this mandatory requirement for all    social areas. However, there is a question among researchers working with social    issues, arguing that the health sector is moving outside its field when attempting    to regulate actions in other fields of investigation. Grounded on philosophical    anthropology, this paper is divided into three parts: (1) elements of anthropological    foundations of ethics; (2) contributions of Anthropology to thinking about ethics    and human rights in health; (3) internal and external questioning about anthropological    practice. I conclude that if the ethical issue that involves human beings cannot    be reduced to the procedures established by Ethics Committees, discussions in    greater depth are required among social scientists on the construction of a    practice based on and guided by respect for the intersubjectivity of all the    players engaged in a research project. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Key words:</b> Ethics in social research,    Ethical grounds of anthropology, Ethics and health </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="VERDANA"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Neste artigo, busco problematizar a forma como    a quest&atilde;o da &eacute;tica em pesquisa social vem sendo tratada hoje pelas    comiss&otilde;es institucionais inspiradas nas quest&otilde;es da biomedicina.    Essa discuss&atilde;o &eacute; particularmente importante para as Ci&ecirc;ncias    Sociais em Sa&uacute;de pois existe uma obrigatoriedade de apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o    dos nossos projetos para avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o dos comit&ecirc;s. A rigor,    na concep&ccedil;&atilde;o da Resolu&ccedil;&atilde;o 196/1996 do Conselho Nacional    de Sa&uacute;de, essa obrigatoriedade cobre todas as &aacute;reas sociais. No    entanto, existe questionamento dos pesquisadores que lidam com o social, argumentando    que o setor sa&uacute;de extrapola quando tenta regular a&ccedil;&otilde;es    de outros campos de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o. Fundamentado na antropologia    filos&oacute;fica, este texto se divide em tr&ecirc;s partes: (1) alguns elementos    sobre fundamentos antropol&oacute;gicos da &eacute;tica; (2) contribui&ccedil;&otilde;es    da Antropologia para pensar a &eacute;tica e a realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o dos    direitos humanos em sa&uacute;de; (3) questionamentos internos e externos sobre    a pr&aacute;tica antropol&oacute;gica. Concluo dizendo que, se a quest&atilde;o    &eacute;tica que envolve seres humanos n&atilde;o pode se reduzir aos procedimentos    demandados por Comiss&otilde;es de &Eacute;tica, &eacute; preciso aprofundar    a discuss&atilde;o dos cientistas sociais na constru&ccedil;&atilde;o de uma    pr&aacute;tica pautada e orientada pelo respeito &agrave; intersubjetividade    de todos os atores envolvidos numa pesquisa. </font> </p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Palavras-chave:</b> &Eacute;tica em pesquisa    social, Fundamentos &eacute;ticos da antropologia, &Eacute;tica e sa&uacute;de</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Internationally speaking, there is a sufficiently    critical mass able to challenge inadequacies of the Ethical Commissions for    Biomedical Research with Human Beings when it comes to qualitative research.    This disquiet is also dealt with by a researcher who is a member of the Ethical    Committee in Research and has written about this inadequacy in her doctorate    thesis dissertation<SUP>1</SUP>. Ethical committees around the world have been    created due to the demand, as well as to social and governmental pressure to    try to control the means by which knowledge had traditionally been constructed,    besides use given to biomedical discoveries. Once the same procedures were used    in social researches, it was inevitable that tensions would aroused in terms    of inadequacies as to transposed procedures&#32;&#150;&#32;as one can see from texts    by Guerriero<SUP>1</SUP>,Victora &amp; Oliven<SUP>2</SUP>, Social    Science and Humanities Research Ethics Special Working Committee: Giving voice    to the spectrum<SUP>3</SUP>, The Indian Committee for Ethics in Social Science    Research in Health: ethical guidelines for social research in health<SUP>4</SUP>,    among others. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this text, I present discussion in four parts:    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Anthropological framework on ethics; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Possible contributions from Anthropology to    ethics (recognition of human rights) in health; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">.

Some questions for deeper discussion.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Anthropological framework on ethics</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be rather pretentious for me to add    something to what has been the focus of discussion. However, following Guerriero's<SUP>1    </SUP>clues to questions of the area, in this paper, I seek support in the challenges    of place, role and responsibility of anthropology in the ethical issue. I speak    of anthropology and not of qualitative research, since, to me, the latter is    a derivation of anthropological assumptions, only to gain meaning when it goes    beyond informants' speeches, and covers the fundamental aspects of human interactions   &#32;&#150;&#32;treated by anthropology. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I try to get away from action normatization of    trends&#32;&#150;&#32;not because they are not important, but because, as I understand,    they presuppose a level of approach in which bioethics must be humanistic, treated    by philosophical anthropology. This field of knowledge defines the constitution    of subjects, as well as of intersubjective relationship as founders of humanism,    but in bioethics these concepts are treated differently by pragmatic and principalist    approaches, and by those who call themselves personalists and humanists. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Neves<SUP>5</SUP> carries out an extensive research    on the foundations of Anglo-American and pragmatic bioethics. According to the    author, their bases assume a consequentialist position to whom an utilitarian    criterion is the only definition of action morality. Neves<SUP>5</SUP> states    that: <I>a relativist sense arises in Anglo-American ethical reasoning, developing    either in casuistic or in situationist ethical terms. Norms for moral conduct    are sought to be established, thus contributing to the highlighted success of    this perspective in the clinical practice realm.</I> According to Neves, the    presence of bioethicicists is routinely seen in North American health institutions   &#32;&#150;&#32;which clearly shows the functionalism and technicalism of bioethics,    treated as a subject and an area of knowledge construction in itself. In this    type of action normatization, the basis coincides with the norm itself. The    "personalist" critique (term used by Neves on the European view) of    Anglo-American view is basically held on two main topics: (1) the one-sidedness    with which this approach considers the person and (2) the overvaluation of the    human being as a rational being, with their own will, which will accentuate    their individualistic inclination. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, the "personalist and    humanistic" view, of phenomelogical, existentialist and hermeneutic origins,    is deepened by Gadamer's<SUP>6</SUP> comprehension reasoning and by Habermas<SUP>7</SUP>.    It is discussed in Apel's<SUP>8</SUP> argumentative proposal, which places    the responsibility of each person for societal aspects at the ethical plain.    It is further radicalized with L&eacute;vinas'<SUP>9 </SUP>ethics of alterity.    All the way through these positions, the subject notion is based on the uniqueness    of each one's concrete reality and on the universal characteristics of the human    kind, leading to the central concept that the subject is only constructed through    communication with the OTHER&#32;&#150;&#32;which give rise to an understanding of    intersubjectivity as a dimension of subjectivity. In the "personalist"    European thought, unity of subjectivity, relatedness of intersubjectivity and    societal solidarity are inseparable. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">L&eacute;vinas<SUP>9</SUP> proposes breaking    with the idea of subject totality: since, according to him, the subject is not    on a pedestal from where they can encompass everything and everyone. Challenging    the ontological concept of subject, L&eacute;vinas demonstrates that the one-on-one    meeting is prior  to reasoning, and the    meeting with the OTHER is prior to the knowledge about oneself. Well, it is    this meeting with the OTHER that ask for and conducts to an open dialogue, to    infinity, and destroys not only the ontological closure, but also the centrality    based on subjectivity (totalitarian and individualistic) in favor of intersubjectivity.    Thus, the new Humanism would be the history of each one's uniqueness in this    face-to-face relationship: a relationship in which one cannot dissolve the other,    but in which the making sense possibility depends of the proximity and understanding    of the other. L&eacute;vinas further attacks the distancing elements which are    so common in positivist sciences: he deepens the idea that in face-to-face meetings,    being <U>benevolent</U> is not enough, since openness is necessary, overcoming    egotism and the rejection of the other are necessary. The author also reminds    us that <U>benevolence</U> without intersubjectivity can sound like the highest    expression of domination of the other, as a means of self-projection, whilst    keeping the state of over position in relation to the other, who is in a inferior,    submissive situation<SUP>9</SUP>. To summarize, according to L&eacute;vinas'    thought, it is Ethics, and not <U>Ontology</U> that constitutes the first Philosophy,    since it is in the face-to-face relationship that the human being creates all    meaning. It is when facing the OTHER that the subject realizes that they are    responsible and sympathetic.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Contributions of anthropology to ethical reasoning    in health</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reader will probably have noticed my <I>part    pris</I> for the "personalist" and "humanist"<SUP>5 </SUP>roots    of bioethics. I understand that when we speak of ethics in health, our central    focus is the <U>human being</U>, being the key concepts: <I>the subjectivity    oneness, the relatedness character of intersubjectivity </I>and <I>the solidarity    in society </I>composing the <U>human fundamental equality</U> which gathers    researchers, their interlocutors and any person in society. I understand <I>human    fundamental equality</I> as the ability that each one has to think, feel, express    themselves and act, each acting logically and based on their own experiences.    This is the principle that shows us that we are capable of "being"    in intersubjectivity and in our contextualization in and of the world. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this sense, I argue that the anthropological    practice, can, due to their theoretical-methodological tradition, contribute    to strengthen intersubjectivity, to broaden the understanding of human problems    and to clarify and inform about procedures and practices of the social life.    Therefore, I also argue that, under certain conditions, the anthropological    practice draws together conditions that enable people to act with ethics and    to promote the rights of groups with which researchers act. I will, however,    seek to put into perspective this last proposition to the maximum. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides all the philosophical and theoretical    aspects, one of the most significant contributions of anthropology occurs precisely    in its methodological approach. Despite there being, in this field, many theories,    methods and anthropological designs, empirical operationalization of researches    show elements that are in common, elements that traditionally have guided the    researcher in field work or in an understanding anamnesis. From an anthropological    point of view, the scientific model used to understand the social world bear    the following principles: (a) <U>intersubjectivity</U>: we are considered in    relation to others; (b) <U>understanding</U>: in order to target the world in    which we live, we need to understand things and social realities as relevant;    (c) <U>rationality and internationality</U>: the social world is always composed    of actions and interactions that obey uses, customs, rules or that are about    the means, the ends and the results<SUP>10-17. </SUP> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For this reason, the anthropological method (a)    allows for a criticism of pseudo-objectivism of science, proposing subjectivity    as founder of meaning; (b) makes subjectivity relevant as constitutive of the    social being and inherent to the scope of objective self-comprehension; (c)    places its focus on human experience and on the acknowledgement of the complexity    of human relations (d) shows that it is important to value relationships and    to understand people in their own social contexts; (e) emphasizes that the production    of "truths about people" occurs in face-to-face meetings and through    empathy between interlocutors. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nonetheless, Anthropology also works with the    concept of objectivity, as long as we can understand that all objectivity undergoes    a subjectivity construction. For this reason, it seeks to (a) explicit the context    rationality and the internal logic of the several actors and groups that are    being studied; (b) present dynamic analysis of reality; (c) always corroborates    that all human beings produce meanings, and plan and project their future; and    (d) their conclusions, despite their never being universal-like, allow us to    understand peculiar contexts, producing comparisons and the most broadening    inferences. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we bring the anthropological method to the    area of health, we understand that it serves to understand: (a) cultural values    and representations; opinions and beliefs about health and ailments; both in    biomedical and in traditional terms; (b) the relationships between each of the    members of health groups, as well as the patients and their family members;    the logic of the health institutions and specific social movements; and (c)    evaluation of policies, practices, proposals, systems and attention models,    from its formulation, technical application to the relevance that the several    subjects ascribe to them<SUP>18</SUP>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we think, for example, of the relationship    between a health professional and a patient in anamnesis, anthropologists would    advise the former to believe in the narrative provided by their interlocutor    as one of the possible versions of their problem: (a) there is logical consistency    in the patient's expressions when they describe what they have experienced seeking    to give an order to the meanings reported; (b) there is mutual possibility of    considerate interpretation (from the health professional and from the part of    the patient) in the dialogue construction; and (c) the patient's report could    be based on empirical or imaginary reality that goes beyond them, in any case    being effective to them. As William Thomas'<SUP>19 </SUP>, himself an anthropologist,    theorem goes: "When someone defines their situation as real, it is real    in its consequences", thus placing evidence on one of the dilemmas of those    who work with people&#32;&#150;&#32;which is the case of health professionals&#32;&#150;&#32;   i.e., that of <U>overcoming formal and functionalist interpretive schemas. </U>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anthropology would also teach the health professionals    that, methodologically speaking, we need to, first of all, listen to how our    interlocutor <I>defines their situation</I><SUP>20</SUP>. Secondly, we need    to know what their <I>biographical experience </I>is, bearing in mind that each    person is always biographically situated in their life world and that it is    in such context that they think, feel and act. Thirdly, we need to find out    what their <I>stock of knowledge </I>is, i.e., what their sedimentation of experiences    and situations lived are&#32;&#150;&#32;knowing that it is from this knowledge that    they interpret the world and support their actions. Fourthly, it is necessary    that we ask ourselves what the interlocutor considers <I>relevant </I>in their    speech, since their <I>relevance structures </I>are related to the knowledge    background and to their biographical situation<SUP>20</SUP>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Believing that a relationship between different    people that respect each other under the conditions of health professional and    patient would be possible, the field of anthropology would also highlight that    there is a "<I>reciprocity of perspective, communication, community, objectives    and subjective interpretation</I>"<SUP>20 </SUP>- which can always occur    in interlocution. For this reason, <I>intersubjectivity </I>would be a central    category to understand relationship and for the analyses produced both in clinical    and in preventative and promotional processes. According to Schutz<SUP>20</SUP>    <I>"</I>here where I am&#32;&#150;&#32;there where my peer is: we can never be    in the same place, in the same position, never be both here or there<I>"</I>,    however, there is a situation of familiarity that is created by means of institutional    and personal mechanisms, under the form of <I>"us", </I>allowing for    the understanding of the other as unique in one's individuality.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Movements that hinder intersubjectivity in    health</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Accepting evidences that ailments are not only    biological entities since they are also linked, to different extents, to peoples    ways of life, to the pluralist treatment offers and cure, to the greater presence    of society in the control it exercises on medical and epidemiological interventions    make the health field much more open to receive contributions from anthropology.    However, it is necessary to bring light to some external and internal movements    that once again tend to challenge this interaction.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>The biological reductionism</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first one comes from the ideology that supports    contemporary genetics and that takes scientists to return to the dream nourished    by bacteriologists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries<SUP>21</SUP>.    Nunes, in a classical work, has analyzed how scientific revolution caused by    the discoveries of bacteriology led medical studies to be guided by a reflection    of rejection of the social issue, in favor of a technological empire. Ideology    created around these discoveries has become reference to Western medicine: (1)    an effective "combat" (please note the military terminology!) of acute    ailments, by means of immunization and treatment; (2) centralization of actions    pertaining to defined biological ailments; (3) optimism in relation to the eradication    of epidemics; (4) and the re-organization of medical teaching with a sole focus    on the biological field<SUP>21</SUP>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is clear that scientific development enabled    by bacteriology was and still is important for the     human kind. What we put forth in order for all to reflect about in terms of    ideas and practice is the rejection of economic, social, cultural and subjective    factors of infirmities and health promotion, reducing these phenomena to entities    or simply to biological processes, leaving behind a long tradition of social    medicine that was fully used during half of the nineteenth century. Today, fragmentation    produced by biomedical reductionism leads us to have, inside a hospital, the    reduction of a sick person to simply their body, a mere object of manipulation    and interventions. Everything is opposed to the proposals of the World Health    Organization exposed in the Ottawa Letter and in the Alma Ata Declaration which    represent a broadened definition of public health/collective health, founded    on the understanding of conditions, situations and life styles. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, from the end of the twentieth century,    we have been confronted by attempts to think of health as a biologically determined    process only. This emerging ideology was researched by the French anthropologist,    Lucien Sfez<SUP>22</SUP>. He produced an essay on representations of health    and illnesses in contemporary American, Japanese and French societies, and he    discovered that there is a tendency&#32;&#150;&#32;which reaches its peak in the American    society&#32;&#150;&#32;to construct an utopian and practical paradigm of <I>perfect    health, </I>supported by the development of biology, of pure environment and    of technologies for drug production known as fourth generation medicine. Sfez<SUP>22</SUP>    states that this project is being constructed by a scientific and technological    elite under the protection of powerful economic and financial interests. It    takes place in a moment of extraordinary scientific advances in the biological    area, especially in the genetic area, in tune with powerful health insurance    companies and with the health industry in general. The niche of investment in    these researches has produced a true myth of attainment of the <I>perfect health    </I>by means of <I>genetic prediction </I>(with the purpose of replacing the    concept of <I>illness prevention),</I> as if it were possible to replace will,    desire and human action by technological artifacts. This myth has been challenged    by important authors even in the area of biology, such as Henry Atlan<SUP>23</SUP>    in his <I>L'uterus artificiel</I> (in English, <I>The artificial womb</I>).    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Clinical and epidemiological technicism</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second movement that tends to eliminate the    historical subject (intersubject and sympathetic) and that is situated in the    health area is the technicism of clinic and epidemiology, whose belief that    truth is originated from refining the method creates an illusion of number,    data and model certainty. They lack <I>"the flesh, the bones and the soul    of social life", </I>as Malinowiski<SUP>24 </SUP>would remind us. Many    anthropologists and sociologists have been speaking against this technicist    trend which is occurring in many fields. In the health area, bursts aimed at    evidencing the truths and objectivity have forgotten to ask fundamental questions    and to situate people's problems in the dynamics of the contexts in which they    occur, their lives, their relations and their representations. For this reason,    technicist studies gather data on the reality, treat infirmities as entities    that are external to the patients that suffer, lessening efficacy of the necessary    human contacts in the health area. <U>Facing this challenge, the Ethical Committees    that base their work on ly on normativeness can do very little because thought    philosophy is what divides people in researchers and objects.</U></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Exotism of anthropology</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A third aspect that makes this a difficult interrelation    between the health sector - which strictly points to the technique&#32;&#150;&#32;and    anthropology derives from the practice of anthropologists themselves. First    of all, many times we have professed a very enclosed reflection, which hinders    the access of health professionals to our findings and contributions. However,    an even greater difficulty is the one defined by Raynaut<SUP>25</SUP> as: <I>How    to make the psychological and social sciences admit that the human being is    not composed only of a spirit, but also of a body. How to make them admit also    that human societies cannot be analyzed only from their cultural dimension,    solely taking into account their representations, their behavioral models, the    means by which they organize their relations? How can we get the humanities    to integrate this evidence that social systems can only exist because they are    rooted in a biological reality: that of bodies and that of the members?</I>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Raynaut's words call our attention to the risk    of omnipotence which is typical of the unidisciplinarity. One of the relationship    difficulties that exist between health professionals and anthropologists is    the temptation from the latter to transform medicine, as well as health activities    only as social or discourse evidence. When this happens, we see disregard of    social sciences from technique, this practical art that makes the human being    recreate nature. Analyses of health and     ailments as social facts&#32;&#150;&#32;taking no notice of the biological essence    of phenomena&#32;&#150;&#32;produce the same reductionist perspective that medicine    has of social phenomena&#32;&#150;&#32;only in reverse. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to interact in partnership, the anthropology    of contemporary health needs to feel challenged by the criticism of epidemiologists    and of practicioners<SUP>25</SUP>, theoretically admitting (since in practice,    the anthropologists know and feel it) that human beings are composed of spirit    and body and that social wholeness are based on the biological reality of bodies.    This note might sound obvious if not for the proliferation of a type of scientific    production that na&iuml;vely uses phenomenological, symbolic interactionist    and constructivist models, making people's speeches the truth about their own    problems. Scholars that use such approaches superficially or in a reduced manner,    analyze representations, relations and the social construction of health and    ailment situations as if they were whole, leading to query from the medical    areas and from epidemiology as to the need, the origin and the scientificity    of their findings. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is necessary to highlight that in health/ailment    phenomena interpretations, the anthropologists are seen as the "readers    of reality" and that, within a hegemonic model, the predominance is of    the "biomedical reading". Legitimacy of anthropological findings by    biomedicine with all its implications (and vice-versa) occurs as a kind of tacit    agreement between the agents involved, the institutions, practices, relations    and ideas. From the anthropological point of view this agreement is expressed    in the respect for the important and irreplaceable role played by scientific    medicine in contemporary society. From the biomedical point of view, on the    other hand, it is expressed by accepting and valuing the idea that the population   &#32;&#150;&#32;regardless of whether one considers only those who use the public health    and medical system, or those who use combined means of treatment, regardless    of whether they only use alternative or traditional therapeutics&#32;&#150;&#32;possesses    rationality. <U>In this meeting with alterities (which brings in itself the    ethical foundation of relations and of action) one can see the understanding    of the humanization of technique which, can only make sense in the health area    if it is to improve the life quality of people.</U> Thus, understanding that    the health area is a pluri-disciplinary field in dispute for power and legitimacy<SUP>26,27</SUP>,    between the medical paradigm (hegemonic for all the health science professions)    and the anthropology, there will always be possible relations: complementary,    conflictuous or of rejection, depending on the context, the problems and the    agents that take part in the interaction. However, it is the responsibility    of the field of anthropology to call attention to the essential characteristic    of intersubjectivity and empathy with the essential values in the health sector.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Ethical dilemmas in anthropological research</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Field research, the place where all ethnological    career begins, is mother and breastfeeding milkmaid of doubt, a philosophical    attitude by excellence.This anthropological doubt does not consist only of knowing    that one knows nothing, but of resolutely exposing what one thought was known    and their very ignorance to the insults and the denials that affect the ideas    and the dearest habits to those that can refute them at the highest level<SUP>28</SUP>.</I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problems of interaction between researcher    and social agents in the field research</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this point, I intend to challenge the relationship    of anthropologists and researchers (who have worked with qualitative research)    with their field interlocutors. Nothing is simple and everything is complex    in this relationship. In recent conversation with people from a slum, I heard    the following expression: <I>"researchers are people's 'chupa-cabra'. They    research, take their conclusions, publish, improve in their careers and the    people continue in their poverty conditions". Chupa-cabra</I> is    a creature believed to inhabit part of the Americas. It is mostly associated    to Puerto Rico, Mexico and the even in the Latin American communities of the    United States. Its name literally means 'goat sucker' since the creature is    said to drink the blood of livestock. Would the awareness development of rights    make it even more difficult for the investigator to approach their empirical    field? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the researcher&#32;&#150;&#32;researched social group    relationship, the critical observations of Social Sciences reach two levels    of questions, both brining relevance to the problematic characteristic of interaction.    On the one hand, there are several theories that emphasize the inequality situation    in which interviews take place, leading the critics to state that the researcher's    work is of domination and of a 'reproductivist' nature. On the other hand, in    opposition to the first view, there are scholars that highlight that, from a    cultural perspective, interaction is necessary    to empirical research, which is intrinsically conflictuous, but experienced    within a spirit of freedom, not of necessity. For this reason, the latter consider    that both researchers and researched are responsible for the product of their    relations and that the quality of unveiling and of social understanding depends    of both. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The basic premise for reflection, in both cases,    is that human interaction in an <I>interview </I>situation, for example, cannot    simply be considered a work of data collection. It will always constitute an    <I><U>intersubjective relationship</U> </I>in which information provided by    subjects can be profoundly affected by the nature of the meeting itself.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Viewing the research situation as a peculiar    expression of domination</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The focus of the debate is the unequal exchange    among social agents. This certainly occurs and under several perspectives: it    is not the interviewee that takes the initiative; the actual research objectives    are usually unknown to them; their chances of taking any initiative in relation    to the theme is very little; the researcher is the one directing, controlling    and guiding what will be said, besides being the person controlling turns, even    when they try to make the interviewee feel comfortable. The nice and benevolent    attitude showed by the scholar minimizes the impact, but does not reverse the    situation of inequality between interlocutors. Even in the so-called 'participative    research' and 'action research' these issues can be placed, though less vehemently.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, social research would be a prisoner of    labor division in capitalist society, by means of which, the researcher, in    an institutional position of power, takes on the right to question the other,    the society and its structural and organizational forms. Within this view, the    subject/object (the interviewee) would produce material that is ultimately explored    by their domineering peers (the researchers, in this case). This is, for example,    Kandel's<SUP>29</SUP> opinion: <I>"</I>Those investigated are faced with    objective frames of reference with which they are (most of the times) unfamiliar.    Reciprocity, if any, (such as in the right to question the questioner) is granted<I>"</I>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>View of the research situation in the context    of general production relations</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The group that puts the enclosed circle of reproductivist    reflection into perspective and criticizes it argues that if a piece of empirical    research is included in the system of class domination, materialized in the    scholars' roles, this situation cannot be withdrawn from the analyzed society.    Therefore, looking at each particular research situation as domineering will    not promote any practical consequence besides that of provoking a scientific    stand still. Secondly, these sociologists of science argue that it is possible    to carry out investigations with clear social, strategic objectives aimed at    better understanding problems, improving services, evaluating programs of social    intervention and other social actions ethically worthy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Within this point of view, one considers that    social researchers need to take into account that in fact, the practice of empirical    social research is carried out in a contradictory context, where social asymmetric    forms are reproduced, since scholars have access to certain types of actual    and symbolic legacy from which a great number of people are excluded. Even if    their interlocutors are from the same social class, theoretical reflection is    far more familiar to the researcher than to their interviewees. Recognizing    this does not mean that one needs to stop carrying out investigations, since    the mechanisms of inequality and dissymmetry within society are much broader    and complex, and are present in all kinds of relationships. It is necessary,    however, to more clearly admit to oneself what the <U>meaning of the investigation</U>    is especially when it comes to the health area, where researchers are dealing    with life and death -, thus attempting to provide solutions to the population's    problems. By the same token, it is necessary to emphasize the means and proposals    by which the information provided, the situations created and the alliances    reflect the interests of those interviewed.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problems intrinsic to social interactions    in fieldwork</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some authors have investigated field situations    with intrinsic concern with the action of researching itself, thus producing    a type of epistemology about the production conditions of social knowledge.    Generally they are anthropologists that evidence the shakiness of the philosophical    concept of scientific truth, from their empirical experience, and of difficulties    found both in the participative observation and in interviews. They demonstrate    the insertion in the "other's" world and challenge the <U>pretentious    objectivity, clarity and transparency in research </U><U>situation</U>.    They evidence that social reality is a world of shades and light in which all    the actors involved reveal and hide their group secrets. Instead of the passivity    characteristic that the reproductivist and positivist theories, from different    points of view, allow these agents (understanding, symbolic interactionists    and phenomenologists) these researchers understand them as part of the active    movement during the whole process of contact with the researcher. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Examples of these kinds of researchers are Goffman<SUP>30,31</SUP>    and Berreman<SUP>32</SUP> who designed rich, and plastic reflection, full of    detail on the researcher/researched exchange. Both used theater images to show    that this pair simultaneously constitutes actors and audience in the setting    up of a unique show: their interrelation is mediated by specific cultural codes    and by the private interests that both try to preserve and project. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the relationship of the interviewer and their    informants, Goffman<SUP>31</SUP> states that: <I>We often discover a division    between the interior region&#32;&#150;&#32;where representation is part of a pre-prepared    routine; the external region&#32;&#150;&#32;where representation is presented. Access    to these regions is controled so as to stop the audience to see the behind the    scenes and that foreigners have access only to a representation that is set    for them</I>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goffman's words, which appear in several of his    works on total institutions and stigmas, are confirmed by Berreman's<SUP>32</SUP>    reflections on the difficulties of having access to information in ethnographic    research in a Himalayan community. Berreman<SUP>32</SUP> socializes his experience    describing them in images. He calls the "interior region" the most    intimate part of the experience with the community. This region can be broader    or stricter, he says, but all groups save their secrets, their official side,    and all of them have a daily behavioral strategy. This internal cohesion occurs    because, even if internally a group may experience many differences and conflicts,    their existence depends on a certain degree of consensus, familiarity and solidarity    which implies in sharing meaning, secrets, forbidden zones and also sharing    what can and what cannot be said. In the same perspective as Berreman<SUP>32</SUP>,    Goffman's<SUP>29 </SUP>statement is clarifying when he says that there are few    activities or daily relations in which agents are not involved in the hidden    practices incompatible with the impressions that they seek to cause. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because of this contingency of the interior region   &#32;&#150;&#32;from both parts &#150;, there will always be a game, in any situation    of field work, between the researcher&#32;&#150;&#32;who is getting in touch and the    speech and the behavior of their interlocutors. The latter always intends to    keep a secret about the <I>"interior region" </I>(concept used by    Berreman) or to have <I>"control over impressions" </I>(expression    used by Goffman) that they provoke. This control is a basic aspect, inherent    to interaction. For this reason, it is important that every social investigator    knows that no group will say the whole truth about a social reality. There will    always be a "control of impressions" and the safeguarding of the "interior    region". </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Berreman<SUP>32</SUP> insists that both agents    in research (interviewer/interviewee), in a situation of interaction, brief    as it may be, act by judging the motives and attributes that the others bring;    defining the situation and the image they wish to project. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore, there is no possibility of clarity    or total transparency, as there is no scientific neutrality.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Dilemmas of the process of participative observation</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">People that introduce the researcher in the field    are (just as the researcher themselves) responsible for their images, as well    as for all the doors that might be open or be shut. Accumulated experience shows    that the profile of interlocutors and the quality of data gathered are related    to the impact of the researcher's entry and introduction<SUP>24</SUP>. However,    their sensitivity and sympathetic ability in the field may decrease the initial    impacting aspects. In the specific situation of research, empathy is at stake,    as is the ability to observe and the researcher's acceptance&#32;&#150;&#32;which cannot    be changed into a practical recipe. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A second moment of insertion (here understood    only for analytical purposes) is that of researcher's role definition<SUP>18</SUP>    within the group where they are being integrated. The actual roles that the    researcher will play will vary according to the situation of research. Actually,    in terms of groups elected, the researcher is less observed for the logical    basis of their studies, and much more for their personality and behavior. Those    who introduce them in the field and their interlocutors want to know if they    are "good people", if they will not "harm the group", if    they will not betray "their secrets" and their strategies for solving    life problems. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are multiple situations of research. However,    as a rule of thumb, the researcher's image is constructed only in partial collaboration    with them, since the image that they project reverberates    in the group by the references that the group has, within their specific cultural    standards. By the same token, the image that the researcher builds of the group    depends of the people with whom they relate. Thus, both sides build images that    will always be incomplete and imprecise<SUP>18</SUP>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leaving the field is also a crucial moment. Interpersonal    relations that are developed during the research are not automatically undone    with the conclusion of activities planned. There is an informal "contract"    of favors and of loyalty that cannot be abruptly broken lest there be deception:    investigators work with people, therefore, with relations and with affection.    There are not recipes for this moment, but some questions can be asked and answered    by the researcher: what will relations that follow the field work be like? What    is the commitment of the researcher with the group as far as primary data collected    may be, as well as their scientific uses and the means by which they will be    returned? In short, leaving the field involves ethical and practical problems.    Intersubjective relations that area created can contribute to define the type    of moment when the break is necessary from more intense relations, as well as    a plan for possible and desirable continuity. However, above all, the <U>ethicak    commitment remains that the research must result in benefic for the society    and, if applicable, for the group that accepted to take place in the research</U><SUP>18</SUP>.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Denzin<SUP>33</SUP> insists that, in comparison    to scientists that work with surveys, the field research that uses participative    observation is freer from losses, since they are not necessarily prisoners of    a rigid data collecting instrument or hypotheses testing prior rather to during    the research process. The flow which is bound to the nature of participative    observation allows the researcher the possibility of using, at the same time,    the data provided by surveys. As the observer deals with the group, they can    take from their script questions that they realize may be irrelevant from the    interlocutors' points of view; they can also understand aspects that become    evident little by little, an impossible situation for a researcher who works    with closed questionnaires which are previously standardized. Participative    observation assists, therefore, in the linking of facts and their representations,    and to unveil contradictions between norms and rules, and the practices experienced    in the daily lives of the group. It is absolutely impossible to ask people to    accept being observed. <U>This procedural field dynamics denies the formalities    of instruments required by Ethical Committees. </U> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In terms of <I>objectivity, </I>by opposing what    the positivists call the <I>impressionism of subjectivity, </I>Cicourel<SUP>34</SUP>    comments that the higher the observer's participation, the greater the risk    of their involvement, but, at the same time, the greater the possibility of    their being able to penetrate the "interior region" of the group.    This author highlights that objectivity control of data obtained via participative    observation must be carried out with critical revisions of the field work, by    means of the explanation of the procedure adopted and of the different roles    played by the members of the researched group and of the researcher. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this sense, criteria used for trustworthiness    meet those of ethical behavior requirements, which must be part of every research,    <U>making the information sources explicit, as well as the context in which    the research was carried out, both from the institutional point of view, the    relationship between researched and their interlocutors, besides the situation    and the work conditions in the field. Information on the conditions of research    fulfillment is part of the contextualized understanding of the object of study.    </U> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I conclude this paper by highlighting that difficulties    faced by researches to enter the field cannot be thought only as challenges    for improving research techniques. There are difficulties that are typical of    this work and that must be objects of reflection and of planning as part of    the knowledge construction strategy within an ethical posture in which the rights    of interlocutors and of researchers are preserved. In this sense, there is nothing    a priori determined, even when there <U>are procedures that are approved by    the ethical committees.</U></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Questions on ethics</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>I have had a few modest objectives with this    paper:</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">· To show that there are contributions from    Anthropology with which we can think ethics in research with human beings. Agreeing    with Neves<SUP>5</SUP>, I can say that they fundamental contribution is its    intrinsic adhesion to the unicity of the subject and to its relational characteristic   &#32;&#150;&#32;which is expressed in the subjectivity and in its ability to demonstrate    solidarity and universality of what I here call fundamental human equality.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">· To evidence the many yet unsolved difficulties    in anthropological practices, especially in the researcher&#32;&#150;&#32;interlocutors    relationship, which does  not allow us    to take a leading position in terms of ethical issues that are asked us and    that go against issues of intersubjectivity and interests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">· I have tried to fundament this paper on    philosophical bases that seem to support the two paradigms from which different    views on ethics in research derive: the pragmatic and principalist and the personalist    and communicative. The ethics of science and technology in which one will find    ethics in research cannot be mediated by current standardized procedures. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">· I have read many works that currently    exist on the controversies of the Ethical Commissions set up to respond to biomedical    research challenges as to anthropological and qualitative investigations. From    all these works, it is possible to derive at the same time the broad sense of    the meaning of ethics, the broadened view of responsibilities that are not condensed    in instruments evaluated by the ethical commission. Most of them highlight not    only ethics within the casuistics of a certain research, but also of the scientific    community relationship with society, of the institutional relationships with    policy makers, researchers and students, and also, the social scientists action    within their research field, as well as outside the field. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Finally, I have no doubt that, in the    specific case of the evaluation of our researches, it is necessary to provide    criteria to those who will be judging them. But I take a stronger stand stating    that we should produce a kind of rationale, followed by guiding elements for    evaluators, submitting this proposal (which could be standardized) to public    debate. Otherwise, we will continue to have that same that is happening, leading    to a kind of complacent cynicism from the behalf of qualitative researchers    that, having to submit to current Ethical Commissions, break the philosophical    and practical principles of a great deal of the research in their areas. For    example: to provide the exact number of field interlocutors; write up an instrument    requiring those who are going to be observed for their consent, define closed    instruments for investigation and for observation, among others. As Neves<SUP>5</SUP>    very well concludes, in Latin America, the principalist and pragmatic Anglo-American    norm and European personalist and humanistic concerns are in conflict. However,    the one that is being enforced is the former.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b> References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.
