<h2>Aspects/Elements of Culture</h2>
Culture is reflected through the various components such as values, norms,
languages, myths, customs, rituals and laws. Two of the most basic aspects of
culture are material and nonmaterial culture. 
<h3>Material Culture</h3>
Material culture consists of human-made objects such as tools, implements,
furniture, automobiles, buildings, dams, roads, bridges, and in fact, the physical
substance which has been changed and used by man
<h3>Non-Material Culture</h3>
It is something internal and intrinsically valuable, reflects the inward nature of man
<h2>Cultural Unity and Variations: Universality, Generality and
    Particularity of Culture</h2>
<h3>1. Universality</h3>
Universals are cultural traits that span across all cultures
E.g. Incest taboo, exogamy (marriage outside oneâ€™s group)
<h3>2. Generality</h3>
Generalities are cultural traits that occur in many societies but not all of them
e.g., farming and nuclear family
<h3>3. particularity</h3>
Trait of a culture that is not widespread. Cultural particulars include the specific
practices that distinguish cultures form one another.
<h2>Cultural change</h2>
Culture change can occur as a result of the following Mechanisms
<h3>Diffusion</h3>
The process by which cultural elements are borrowed from another society
and incorporated into the culture of the recipient group is called diffusion. 
<h3>Acculturation</h3>
Is the exchange of cultural features that results when groups have
continuous firsthand contact
<h3>Invention</h3>
The process by which humans innovate, creatively finding solutions to
problems is a third mechanism of cultural change.
<h3>Globaization</h3>
The term globalization encompasses a series of processes,
including diffusion and acculturation, working to promote change in a world in which
nations and people are increasingly interlinked and mutually dependent.
